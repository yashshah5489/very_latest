Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki

Introduction:
Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book written by Robert Kiyosaki. The book advocates financial literacy, financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one's financial intelligence.

Chapter 1: The Rich Don't Work for Money
The poor and middle class work for money. The rich make money work for them. Most people struggle financially because they do not know the difference between an asset and a liability. An asset puts money in your pocket. A liability takes money out of your pocket. The rich focus on acquiring assets while the poor and middle class focus on income and liabilities.

Chapter 2: Why Teach Financial Literacy?
It's not how much money you make that matters. It's how much money you keep. Financial aptitude is what you do with money once you make it, how you protect it, and how you leverage it to generate more money. Most people struggle financially because they don't understand the difference between wealth and income.

Chapter 3: Mind Your Own Business
The rich focus on acquiring assets, not increasing their income. Your profession is your income source, but your business revolves around your asset column. Kiyosaki suggests that people should focus on building and keeping their asset columns strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out.

Chapter 4: The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations
Corporations can offer significant tax advantages not available to individuals. Understanding business and tax law allows the financially literate to leverage these advantages. The rich have the knowledge to use these systems to their benefit, while the poor and middle class often do not.

Chapter 5: The Rich Invent Money
Financial intelligence enables people to create wealth from nothing. Opportunities are always present, but most people are not trained to recognize them. Investing is not risky if you know what you're doing. Financial intelligence simply means having more options.

Chapter 6: Work to Learn, Don't Work for Money
Specialized skills are important, but so are skills like management, leadership, marketing, and communication. The author recommends working to learn rather than working for money, especially when young.

Chapter 7: Overcoming Obstacles
The main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns:
1. Fear: Overcoming the fear of losing money is essential for success.
2. Cynicism: Doubt and cynicism prevent action; critical thinking is valuable, but cynicism can be paralyzing.
3. Laziness: Often manifested as busyness, laziness keeps people from self-development.
4. Bad habits: Regular savings and investing should become habits.
5. Arrogance: What you don't know is as important as what you do know. Acknowledging ignorance is the first step to learning.

Chapter 8: Getting Started
Ten steps to awaken your financial genius:
1. Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit (your deep emotional wants).
2. Make daily choices: the power of choice (invest in education and choose friends carefully).
3. Choose friends carefully: the power of association.
4. Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of learning quickly.
5. Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline.
6. Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice.
7. Be an "Indian giver": the power of getting something for nothing.
8. Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus.
9. Choose heroes: the power of myth.
10. Teach and you shall receive: the power of giving.

Chapter 9: Still Want More? Here Are Some To Do's
1. Stop doing what you're doing. Take a break and assess what is working and what is not.
2. Look for new ideas. Read books on different subjects, especially how-to books.
3. Find someone who has done what you want to do and take them to lunch.
4. Take classes, attend seminars, and listen to audio recordings.
5. Make lots of offers. Junk investors look at dozens of properties to find one deal.
6. Jog, walk, or drive a certain area once a month for ten minutes to look for investment opportunities.
7. Look for people who want to buy first, then look for someone who wants to sell.
8. Think big. Retailers get rich by selling millions of items with a small markup; small business people try to sell a few items with large markups.
9. Learn from history. All the big companies started out as small companies.
10. Action always beats inaction.

Conclusion:
Financial intelligence is a synergy of accounting, investing, marketing, and law. Combined, these skills allow people to navigate and succeed in the complex world of money. The main management skills needed for success are management of cash flow, systems, and people. The most important specialized skills are sales and marketing. There are five main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns: fear, cynicism, laziness, bad habits, and arrogance.
